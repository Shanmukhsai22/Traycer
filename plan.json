  "potential_risks": [
    "**Potential risks and challenges:**",
    "**Dependencies**",
    "* **Broken dependencies:** Updating or removing dependencies in the backend project (e.g., `app.py`) could break the frontend application if it relies on those dependencies.",
    "* **Version conflicts:** Different versions of dependencies used in the frontend and backend projects could lead to compatibility issues.",
    "**Integration points**",
    "* **API endpoints:** Changes to API endpoints in the backend project could impact the frontend application's ability to interact with the backend services.",
    "* **Data inconsistency:** If the frontend and backend systems are not synchronized, data inconsistencies could occur, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or lost data.",
    "**Potential side effects**",
    "* **Performance degradation:** Changes in the backend project could introduce performance bottlenecks that affect the frontend application's responsiveness.",
    "* **Unexpected behavior:** Changes in the backend logic could lead to unexpected behavior in the frontend application, causing confusion or errors for users.",
    "**Security considerations**",
    "* **Data breaches:** Vulnerabilities in the backend project could potentially expose sensitive data or user information to attackers.",
    "* **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** Malicious input from the frontend application could be reflected back in the backend responses, potentially leading to XSS attacks.",
    "* **Cross-site request forgery (CSRF):** Attackers could exploit a CSRF vulnerability to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.",
    "**Performance impacts**",
    "* **Network latency:** Slow network connections between the frontend and backend servers could impact the application's overall performance and user experience.",
    "* **Server load:** High traffic to the backend servers could result in performance degradation and potential outages, affecting the frontend application's accessibility.",
    "**Mitigation strategies:**",
    "* Thoroughly test all changes to the backend project and ensure compatibility with the frontend application.",
    "* Use version control and dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies.",
    "* Implement proper error handling and monitoring mechanisms to detect and resolve issues quickly.",
    "* Regularly review and update security measures in both the frontend and backend projects.",
    "* Establish clear communication and coordination channels between the frontend and backend development teams."
