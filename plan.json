    "**Technical Requirements and Implementation Details for Resume Upload Pagination and UI Updates**",
    "**Pagination**",
    "* Implement client-side pagination to dynamically load resume pages as the user scrolls or clicks.",
    "* Use a pagination library (e.g., Kendo UI, jQuery DataTable) to handle paging logic, filtering, and sorting.",
    "* Configure the page size, number of visible pages in the pagination control, and the initial page to display.",
    "* Utilize caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce server load.",
    "* Adjust the UI to accommodate the new pagination functionality.",
    "**UI**",
    "* Redesign the resume upload page to enhance usability and user experience.",
    "* Implement a progress bar or indicator to display the upload status.",
    "* Add a drag-and-drop feature to enable easy resume selection.",
    "* Provide clear instructions and error messages to guide the user through the upload process.",
    "* Ensure the UI is responsive and works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.",
    "**Dependencies**",
    "* Client-side programming skills (e.g., JavaScript, jQuery)",
    "* Pagination library (e.g., Kendo UI, jQuery DataTable)",
    "* Server-side logic to handle resume upload and database operations",
    "* CSS and HTML for UI styling"

  "affected_components": [
    "**Frontend:**",
    "1. `frontend/vite.config.js` (highest importance): This file contains the configuration for the Vite build system, which may need to be updated to support the new pagination and UI for resume upload.",
    "2. `frontend/dist/assets/browser-eYrUW32K.js` and `frontend/dist/assets/index-COYgshHW.js`: These JavaScript files contain the compiled frontend code, which will likely need to be modified to implement the new features.",
    "**Backend:**",
    "As the description does not mention any backend changes, it is unlikely that the backend files will be affected."

    "**Potential Risks and Challenges:**",
    "**Frontend:**",
    "* **Dependency updates:** Updating `vite.config.js` may require updating dependencies, which could introduce compatibility issues.",
    "* **Code modifications:** Significant changes to `dist/assets` files could break existing functionality.",
    "* **Performance impacts:** New pagination and UI elements may affect page load times and user experience.",
    "**Backend:**",
    "* **No backend changes mentioned:** It's unclear why the backend components are listed as affected in the provided details. If no backend changes are required, it's important to ensure that this is clearly communicated.",
    "* **Dependency compatibility:** If there are any dependency updates for the backend, compatibility issues with existing code may arise.",
    "**General Considerations:**",
    "* **Integration points:** Ensure a seamless integration between the new frontend features and the existing backend functionality.",
    "* **Potential side effects:** Consider how the changes may impact other parts of the application or external systems.",
    "* **Security considerations:** Review the new frontend code for potential security vulnerabilities, especially when handling sensitive user data."
