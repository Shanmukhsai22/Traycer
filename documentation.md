# Implementation Approach - Traycer Task Planner

## Architecture Overview
I structured the implementation into 4 main components, each handling distinct responsibilities:

1. **Task Planner** (`task_planner.py`)
   * Core component responsible for planning task implementation
   * Processes task requirements and generates detailed plans
   * Coordinates with AI engine to analyze requirements and generate step-by-step implementation guides
   * Handles estimations and risk assessment for tasks

2. **Codebase Analyzer** (`codebase_analyzer.py`)
   * Handles all codebase structure analysis
   * Scans project directories while ignoring specified paths
   * Extracts project structure and dependencies
   * Works with AI engine to analyze code patterns and relationships

3. **AI Engine** (`ai_engine.py`)
   * Central component for all Gemini AI interactions
   * Processes requests from both Task Planner and Codebase Analyzer
   * Configures and manages Gemini API communication
   * Handles prompt generation and response parsing
   * Provides unified interface for AI-powered analysis

4. **Helper Functions** (`helpers.py`)
   * Contains shared utility functions
   * Handles file I/O operations
   * Manages path validation
   * Provides output formatting
   * Takes care of saving generated plans

## Main Program Flow (`main.py`)
The main program acts as the orchestrator:
1. Initializes all components
2. Processes command line arguments
3. Coordinates the flow between components
4. Manages the overall execution pipeline
